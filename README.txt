I wrote this program in the hopes that it would help someone, somewhere learn more about computational geometry.
This program has a simple set of features that can be used to gain an understanding of Graham's scan algorithm.

To start off, you should,
	Press 'g' to generate 10 random points on the screen.

If you would like to generate more or less points, you may,
	Press '+' or '-' to increase of decrease the number of points generated by pressing 'g'.

If for whatever reason, at any time, you would like to start over from a clean slate,
	Press 'c' to clear all the points and their associated elements from the sketch.

If you are satisfied with the set of points generated, you may,
	Press 'n' to step through the algorithm at your leisure.

The active controls will be displayed in the upper left corner of the screen. 
I will also be displaying instructions towards the bottom of the window.
When you are incrementally constructing the convex hull, the H that displays below a point is for head,
M is for middle, and T is for tail.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
